		<p>Welcome to my Portfolio, this page will show some of my favourite pieces over the years and if you want to see more work I have done go to the gallery. I am currently 
		in university studying game design and currently in my first. When I leave university, I am hoping that I will be able to get a job working for small indie gaming companies 
		and this will allow me to get the experience I need to work for bigger companies that make well known game franchises.</p>
		
		<p>I have had some work experience but it was working for a company called Mace in the IT department and from my time working there I learnt about hardware inside of 
		computers and what hardware is needed to do certain lines of work, I also learnt about html coding and learning about PHP and I think this would come useful because when
		working inside the gaming industry coding is something that get used a lot and I think knowing this will be useful for my future because I will understand logical errors 
		inside of coding.</p>
		
		<p>The skills I have gained from working at mace are I know lots about hardware inside of computers and what is needed to get the most power from my computer to get on with 
		the work I needed I also have gained other skills liking learning how to code logically, coding which is unique because most people can't code at all because itâ€™s something 
		that can be very hard to learn. I also learnt how to code in school and this was useful as well because I know different coding languages which are Python and PHP. From 
		being at College I have learnt how to use many different programs like After Effects which is one of the best 2D animation programs, Photoshop which is where I can edit 
		initial ideas of designs and making some of my work look better, Dreamweaver and this is good because for when I need to update my online portfolio and I have learnt how 
		to use MAYA which was good for me because out all of these program MAYA is the hardest one to learn because the amount of features that the program has and it one that I
		need to know if I am to go into map/level design in my future.</p>
